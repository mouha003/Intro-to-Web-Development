                    <p>While the pictures on these sites are free, you may need to create a free account to download some images.
                        As you search through the pictures, keep the following guidelines in mind: The picture should be appropriate for the website. 
                        In this case, a portfolio is a professional document, 
                        so you should use a professional-looking image of yourself. 
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        The images you choose for the other two placeholders 
                        should also look professional and relevant to the topic.
                        Make sure that the picture is large enough for the space it will appear in. In the wireframe, it looks like 
                        the images take up a quarter to a third of the horizontal space on the page. If the page is 1000 pixels wide, 
                        then you will want pictures that are 300-400 pixels wide.
                        Start with pictures that are 600-800 pixels wide for now. Remember that while you can size down a picture, 
                        it is much more difficult to make a small picture look good in a larger space.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        You also need to consider the height of the picture, especially if it is in portrait orientation. 
                        Choose a width as a starting point, but be prepared to change the size again later after you've seen it in the web page.
                    </p>

                        Before we can add pictures to the page, we have to find the picture files first.
                         Ideally, they should be pictures you already own, but if not, you can look for appropriate pictures online. 
                         Make sure, though, that you have the right to use whatever pictures you find online, 
                         and that you know how to attribute them if that is a requirement for use.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        As a starting point, if you don't have pictures readily available on your smartphone or your collection of digital pictures, 
                        you can use one of the following sites that distribute photos in the public domain, meaning that you can use them anyway you want, 
                        for any reason, with no attribution requirement.

                    <a href="testimonials.html"><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/04/30/03/26/rufous-5111261__340.jpg"

                        It's important to keep in mind that when you specify an image's size in an HTML page, 
                        you are not actually changing the picture â€“ just how it appears on the page itself. In the example above, 
                        the picture is still 640 pixels wide. but the browser makes it appear smaller.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        As a general rule, you should specify only height or width in the style property, not both. 
                        Specifying only height or width resizes the image while maintaining the aspect ratio. If you do specify both, 
                        you run the risk of distorting the image by making it appear stretched out. As example:
    
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        
                        You also want to avoid forcing the browser to display an image in a format significantly larger than the original image. 
                        The browser can force the image to appear larger, but it cannot add additional pixels, so the image resolution (pixels per square inch) will drop. 
                        The result is often a very grainy or fuzzy picture.
